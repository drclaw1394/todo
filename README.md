#TODO, taskwarrior wrapper for the local directory

Simple wrapper to add scoped task warrior  task tracking to the currectly directory/project.


#Install
Install task warrior
Clone the git
copy the todo script to each of the local directories you would like to use it


#Why
I was tired of typing the project name for each of the tasks I was added to my global task warrior
Having a project local data set means the tasks travel with the project (if you add it to the project git for example). This gives task tracking where ever you work on the project
